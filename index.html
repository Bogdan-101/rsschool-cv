                                My goals are to achieve high results in programming, find excellent IT sphere for myself, where I could build an outstanding applications. I wish to create something unique and take leader positions at the IT market. In my opinion, the most exciting working experience i have got - is when I did my course work for 1 year of studying at BSUIR. back then i wanted to create an app, that will allow not only my friends but any stranger to listen any music from vk. Everyone loved this idea and finally  I did some progress, which can be seen on my github page. I have learned a lot of interesting approaches and ways to create an application, that actually can make some profit.
